  <h2>A Short Bio</h2>
  <p>For a while, I've considered myself an "aspiring everything." I am inspired by so many subjects, I often feel like there is not enough time in the day, or months in a year. Photography, film, music, dance, tech. I could go on. But suffice to say I want to do as much as can in this life, and impaact as many people as possible.</p>
  <h2>Experience + Goals</h2>
  <p>I don't have much experience in coding, but I have been providing products to customers for many years as a graphic designer. Meeting deadlines, responding to customer needs and wants, making revisions, tackling difficult problemsâ€•much of the process is actually very similar. I look forward to entering the development field and finding my niche.</p>
